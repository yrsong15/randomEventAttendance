# Random Event Attendance :performing_arts:

This Python program chooses a number of people from a given text file of names. 

It was motivated by my own experiences as a Resident Assistant at Duke University, where I had to choose 10 people to attend a dinner talk with a Nobel Prize Laureate, Professor Paul Modrich of Duke Medicine. Due to popular demand and a limited number of seats, I wrote a simple Python program to make an unbiased choice.

### Requirements

The program will prompt the user to enter a filename, which should be a newline-separated list of potential attendees.

It will also prompt the user to enter the number of people that can attend the event.

### Compile & Running

```
python main.py
Enter filename: example.txt 
How many people will be attending? 3
```
